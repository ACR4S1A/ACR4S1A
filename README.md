About PonyTown : Feel free to interact w me! I like chatting about anything really, I'm ok with any questions too
I may be a bit awkward in the beginnin 'cause I'm really anxious/shy, and I'm not great at keeping convos going :')

PonyTown status meaning :
- Online/Looking For Chat = feel free to chat w me
- Away = I'm probably off-tab, whisper to me and I'll reply if I see it =)
- Busy = Sometimes I use it if I'm off-tab OR if I'm on my isle and wanna be left alone
